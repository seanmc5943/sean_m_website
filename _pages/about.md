Hi, I'm Sean McCulloch. I'm a PhD student in economics at Brown University. My research interests are in urban economics and applied econometrics.  
I graduated from Cornell University where I studied mathematics and economics. Before starting my PhD, I worked as a RA for Joseph Gyourko and Todd Sinai at the Wharton School.
