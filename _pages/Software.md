#### [Inflate.ado](https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s459037.html)  
Inflate is a Stata program that inflates variables to real dollars using the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI). Useful for putting time series that vary across years, months, or quarters in real dollars, so you do not have to deal with merging in the CPI series yourself!
